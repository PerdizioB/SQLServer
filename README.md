# SQLServer Performance with index and without index
This project is about performance with index and without index using SQL SERVER and SWRL Rules. 
Performance is essential in a database. Using indexes can bring great improvements to database performance, however, they consume a lot of space and this can affect the database. his project analyzes a query and verifies whether an index needs to be created and when it will be necessary to create this index. The hypothetical index was used for the analysis.
The SWRL rule will decide when and if the index creation will be necessary.
